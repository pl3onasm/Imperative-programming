# Dividing large numbers

Given are two positive integers $a$ and $b$ having $n$ and $m$ digits respectively, where $n, m \leq 10^3$. The output of your program should be the quotient of the integer division of $a$ by $b$ on the first line and the remainder of the integer division of $a$ by $b$ on the second line.

The input is given on two lines. The first line contains $a$ and the second line contains $b$. Both lines terminate with a newline character.

## Example

Input:

```text
1000000000000000000008
100000000000000000
```

Output:

```text
10000
8
```
